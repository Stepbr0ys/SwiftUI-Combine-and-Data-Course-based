Hi All👋🏻
I took a cool course SwiftUI Combine and Data and want to share what I learned ✍️
I learned how:
- to create trackable scroll view by using ScrollView, GeometryReader and  PreferenceKey 🔧
- to use Link to open a web page in Safari 🔗
- to load and decode data from a JSON file 📝
- to create view extensions 🔮
- to install Firebase and Firestore 🗂
- to fetch data from Firestore 📚
- to setup Firebase Cloud Message and Apple Push Notification service 📣
- to configure Notifications in AppDelegate 📩
- to observe the ScenePhase change 📲
- to make my application more performant with a lite mode option and verify the user's network connection 🌐
It was an interesting activity to make an application using all these skills 😊
